# Solving exercises in Rust

You can write solutions to these exercises in Rust instead of C:

| exercise                 | the function lib.rs must define                                                                 |

| 00-ps                    | `pub fn ps()`                                                                                   |
| 01-lsof                  | `pub fn lsof()`                                                                                 |
| 02-fuse-helloworld       | `pub fn helloworld(mntp: &CStr) -> c_int`                                                       |
| 03-io_uring              | `pub fn copy(fd_in: BorrowedFd, fd_out: BorrowedFd) -> Result<(), Errno>`                       |
| 04-ext2-read-file        | `pub fn dump_file(img: BorrowedFd, inode_nr: c_int, out: BorrowedFd) -> Result<(), Errno>`      |
| 05-ext2-read-dir         | `pub fn dump_dir(img: BorrowedFd, inode_nr: c_int) -> Result<(), Errno>`                        |
| 06-ext2-walk-path        | `pub fn dump_file(img: BorrowedFd, path: &CStr, out: BorrowedFd) -> Result<(), Errno>`          |
| 07-ntfs-read-file        | `pub fn dump_file(img: BorrowedFd, path: &CStr, out: BorrowedFd) -> Result<(), Errno>`          |
| 08-ext2-read-sparse-file | `pub fn dump_file(img: BorrowedFd, inode_nr: c_int, out: BorrowedFd) -> Result<(), Errno>`      |
| 10-ext2-fuse             | `pub fn ext2fuse(img: BorrowedFd, mntp: &CStr) -> c_int`                                        |
| 13-realpath              | `pub fn abspath(path: &CStr)`                                                                   |

To do that, edit `<exercise>/lib.rs`. Your code would be called via the C test
harness the same way the C solution would. The tests are the same for both.

You should only change one of the `lib.rs` and `solution.c`, don't change both,
the grader chooses the solution to test based on the one you did change.
Submitting both would result in a rejection.

## Rules

- You're not allowed to use `std` and your solutions need to start with `#![no_std]`.
- We use the 2024 edition and the warnings are treated as errors.
- The C glue is generated for you, so you are free to use any rust features in your solution. Do not change the type of the function you are implementing.
- Call the harness callbacks through the `fs101` crate (`fs101.rs` in
  `<exercise>`): for example `fs101::report_file(path)`. The raw C
  declarations are in `fs101::ctest`
- You're given a set of crates, including `rustix` for safe system call wrappers and `libc` for raw system calls when needed.
- Tests run under Valgrind so don't leak memory or leave file descriptors open. The allocator used is the global allocator (`libc` `malloc()`/`free()`).
- Don't define your own `#[panic_handler]` or `#[global_allocator]`.

These crates are available with `use` (no `Cargo.toml` needed):

## Example: 01-lsof

```rust
#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

extern crate alloc;

use alloc::ffi::CString;
use alloc::format;
use alloc::vec::Vec;

use rustix::fs::{CWD, Dir, Mode, OFlags, openat, readlinkat};

pub fn lsof() {
    let dir = openat(CWD, c"/proc/self/fd", OFlags::RDONLY | OFlags::DIRECTORY, Mode::empty())
        .and_then(Dir::new);
    let dir = match dir {
        Ok(dir) => dir,
        Err(e) => return fs101::report_error(c"/proc/self/fd", e.raw_os_error()),
    };
    for entry in dir {
        let Ok(entry) = entry else { break };
        let name = entry.file_name().to_str().unwrap();
        let link = CString::new(format!("/proc/self/fd/{name}")).unwrap();
        if let Ok(target) = readlinkat(CWD, link.as_c_str(), Vec::new()) {
            fs101::report_file(&target);
        }
    }
}
```

(This lists only the solution's own files, so it doesn't pass the tests.)

## Building

To build run `make -f Makefile.rust` in `<exercise>`. It needs rustc 1.85 or
newer on `PATH`, plus bindgen 0.71 or newer, `curl`, `tar`, `sha256sum` and the
Valgrind headers. Like the C build, an exercise needs the headers of its
library: libfuse3 (02, 10), liburing (03), libext2fs (04, 05, 06, 08, 10) or
ntfs-3g (07).

The first build downloads the crates above and compiles them into
`~/.cache/fs101-rust`, later builds reuse them until rustc changes. Build
artifacts go to `.rust/`.

N.B. Keep in mind that the grader may run a different rustc version than yours.
Since warnings are errors, a lint that only one of the versions knows about can
make the build fail on the grader side and vice versa.

For rust-analyzer, run `make -f Makefile.rust rust-project.json` in
`<exercise>` and open that directory in your editor.
